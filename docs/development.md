# Development Process

### 1. Planning
I planned a simple menu-based To-Do List with four main options:
- Add task
- View tasks
- Delete task
- Mark task as done

### 2. Writing the Code
The code was written in Python using VS Code.  
Functions were used to keep the program simple and easy to understand.

### 3. Using Git
- Initialized repository with `git init`
- Added and committed files step-by-step
- Added comments and improvements through meaningful commits
- Created a professional README file
- Added .gitignore file

### 4. Documentation
All documentation files were created in Markdown format inside the `docs` folder.
